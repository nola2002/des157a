            Have you ever been using a website and it feels like you have been filling out input fields forever and you keep going back to fix something and right when you think you're done, a few more questions pop up. Most likely. You may not remember when exactly that happened, but I guarantee you can relate. It feels like it can just be expected when you're filling out check out information or doing an application. The process can be tedious and annoying and even result in abandonment.

            The best UX/UX is invisible. It is so seamless you don't even realize you are iterating with it. Normally there is no “wow, this site is so easy to interact with and clear to navigate”; but rather “wow, this site sucks because it's confusing and I don’t know how to use it”. Good UI/UX is a result of empathy for your user. If you are considering their needs, desires, and their best interest in the design decisions you make, your websites will smooth sailing for your users.

            It is easy to go wrong with forms. There are lots of different options for how to design them. There's drop downs, check boxes, default values, error messages. Lots of consideration is needed for figuring out what will work best for your content.

            I have been filling out an application on the UCEAP website, with so many forms. The quantity has made it tedious but the usability has improved the experience. They use a wide array of input options and have icons to assist with navigation. A long form is difficult for users so finding any way to make it easier will leave them more satisfied.

        <h2>Modals</h2>

        <p>I chose to read the Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows by Naema Baskanderi because the content felt slightly more up to date, which is important since the web is always changing and progressing so quickly. I found lots of important information such as the anatomy of a modal window, each piece is important to a successful user experience.</p>
        <p>Convenient escape is important because often the first reaction is to get out of a pop up, I know that’s what I do. Having a close button in the top corner, an escape key press and a click outside of the pop up window to close are all good ways to give a user multiple outs. A title is important to communicate the purpose of the window. The buttons that submit, confirm, or say yes must have clear separation from the cancel button, done with color or space. Communicating importance for the pop up window can be done by putting a shadow on the background and the size of the window. Another interaction that makes users hate pop ups less is having the window be user initiated, so having a user click something that triggers the window to appear. These small details all contribute to a better experience for the user.</p>
