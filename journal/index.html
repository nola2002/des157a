    <h1>Learning Journal</h1>
    <p>
        Have you ever been using a website and it feels like you have been filling out input fields forever and you keep going back to fix something and right when you think you're done, a few more questions pop up. Most likely. You may not remember when exactly that happened, but I guarantee you can relate. It feels like it can just be expected when you're filling out check out information or doing an application. The process can be tedious and annoying and even result in abandonment.
