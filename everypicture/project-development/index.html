        <p>I had many ideas for my Every Picture Project. I knew I wanted to do something reflecting Whole Earth becasue I am so passoniate about that organization. My first idea was a moving carosel of images and on click the images enlarge and information appears explaining them, showing an array of picture of whole earth throught the years and how it has changed. The other idea was a gallery of posters and programs from Wef from past and present. The idea that I decied to persue is using the map of Wef from last year and on click a pop up appears that shows an image representing that part of the map and provides more information.</p>
