        <h2>Nonviolence & Chaos Control</h2>
        <p>This festival wouldn’t be what it is without all of the awesome people that work tirelessly to make this event happen! All the hands that keep this festival moving attend a Nonviolence meeting.
        One of the many things that make this festival special is the philosophy of nonviolence. We learn, practice, and use the art of active listening and respect to resolve disagreements in a manner that ends well for all parties. Whole Earth rejects the dominant mindset in American culture, that an end to contention results in a victor and vanquished. Nonviolent conflict resolution is a fun and useful practice to not only run a festival but also live life.

        <h2>Love your Mother</h2>
        <p>It’s no coincidence that this festival is always held on mothers day weekend. Whole Earth is a celebration of the life that is given to us by our mothers; especially our Great Mother: Gaia or Mother Earth. Thank you Mother Earth for every leaf on every tree, for the setting and rising sun, for the blue of the sky and green of the grass, for every ripple in every water, every star among the moon, for every every creature small and big, and most of all thank you for the gift of being. Mothers, you are the catalyst of life, what would we do without you!</p>

        <h2>Complete Without Meat</h2>
        <p>Something unique about this event is that none of the food booths offer meat! A long time ago the festival staff decided that this event would be meat free, for the sake of you and I and the animals and the Whole Earth! Eating plant-based is the number one way an individual can reduce their individual impact on the environment, it’s also better for your health. Let’s skip the factory farms and eat plants!</p>

        <h2>Zero-Waste</h2>
        <p>At this festival we recycle, compost, or reuse everything we possibly can to achieve “Zero Waste”. With the help of our compost and recycling directors and their wonderful volunteers all disposed materials are hand sorted to see that they are properly recycled or composted. WERC or Whole Earth Reusable Cooperative aims at keeping the festival free of disposable single use dishes and utensils by providing reusable dishware. This reduces our contribution to landfills, saves forests, prevents land/air/water pollution, and saves on energy costs. Make sure you return your dishes to the dish return booths so they can be cleaned and used again and again!</p>

        <h2>Coffee Booth</h2>
        <p>This festival runs on sweat, love, and a whole lot of cheap coffee. Since we operate on campus and get money from ASUCD's budget we have to follow so many rules and regulations. Like so many. So when the actual festival happens setting the entire thing up and taking it down after is so much work and requires intense phisical labor, staying awake for 48 hours straight, and unhealthy amounts of caffine.</p>
