    <p>I changed my design to not have a color palette besides black and white, because that was distracting from the game, I changed the font to be more continuous with my portal page. I also changed the shape the user is guessing the color of to be more interesting and kind of look like a paint splatter and I decide I want to add animation to the paint splatter shape so It is rotating and I want the circles to enlarge on hover. </p>
